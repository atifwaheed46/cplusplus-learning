# C++ Learning Repository

Welcome to my C++ learning journey! This repository is a collection of my notes, code examples, and resources as I learn C++ from scratch to advanced topics. The goal is to build a strong foundation in C++ programming, covering general skills, fundamentals, object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures and algorithms (DSA), and advanced concepts. Moreover i will not drop the basic thing here , i will drop those topic here that are the pretty tricky and confusing and also some important question that are related to the thinking and researching 

## Repository Structure

This repo is organized into files based on learning categories. Each files contains: like 
- **notes.md**: Summaries and key concepts for that category.
- **code_examples/**: Practice code files to reinforce learning.

## How to Use This Repo
1. Navigate to the folder corresponding to the topic you're interested in.
2. Check the  file for summaries and explanations.
3. Explore the `code_examples/` files for practical implementations.

## Learning Approach
- I’m focusing on understanding concepts deeply and training my problem-solving skills.
- I’ll write my own code and avoid looking at solutions to build critical thinking.
- Feedback or suggestions? Feel free to open an issue or contribute!

Happy coding!
